# FallDamage

A mod for the game Hollow Knight (v1.5.x).

Where one would normally enter the "hard fall" animation after landing with maximum airborne velocity, the player now takes 1 damage and enters regular hit stun.

In simpler terms: don't fall too far; you **will** get hurt.

- Does *not* function on inventory drops
- *Does* function on first drop when starting a New Game

Comes with simple Options menu to enable and disable the mod.
